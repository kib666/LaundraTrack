# ‚úÖ Implementation Complete - Flexible Delivery Type Changes

## Your Request

> "Can see customer can change pick up to delivery when pending, but i also want can change it even in wash and ready if customer use pick up then change to delivery just ask a address, customer can still change it until not completed"

## What We Built ‚ú®

### 1. **Flexible Status Support**

Customers can now change between pickup and delivery when their order is in ANY of these statuses:

- ‚úÖ **PENDING** (new order)
- ‚úÖ **IN_PROGRESS** (being washed) ‚Üê **NEW!**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (ready for pickup/delivery) ‚Üê **NEW!**
- ‚ùå **DELIVERED** (blocked - order done)
- ‚ùå **CANCELLED** (blocked - order cancelled)

### 2. **Address Request Modal**

When switching to delivery, customers are prompted with a modal that:

- Asks for a delivery address
- Validates that address is not empty
- Shows cancel and confirm buttons
- Saves the address to the order

### 3. **Continuous Changes Until Complete**

Customers can:

- Switch from pickup ‚Üí delivery ‚Üí pickup again
- Update the delivery address multiple times
- Make changes at any stage until order is delivered
- Address auto-saves when they click away from the field

## Files Changed

### 1. **Backend: `/app/api/orders/[id]/route.js`**

**Changed Line 119-125:**

```javascript
// BEFORE: Only allowed for 'pending'
if (order.status !== 'pending') {
  return Response.json({...})
}

// AFTER: Allowed for pending, in_progress, ready_for_pickup
const allowedStatusesForUpdate = ['pending', 'in_progress', 'ready_for_pickup'];
if (!allowedStatusesForUpdate.includes(order.status)) {
  return Response.json({...})
}
```

**What it does:**

- Allows customers to update `fulfillmentType` and `deliveryAddress` for orders in washing or ready stages
- Still validates that delivery address is provided when switching to delivery
- Blocks changes only after order is delivered or cancelled

### 2. **Frontend: `/app/customer/page.js`**

**Added State (Line 601):**

```javascript
const [deliveryModal, setDeliveryModal] = useState({
  isOpen: false,
  orderId: null,
  address: '',
});
```

**Added 3 New Functions:**

1. `handleToggleFulfillment(order, fulfillmentType)` (Lines 686-730)
   - Opens modal when switching to delivery
   - Directly updates when switching to pickup
2. `handleDeliveryAddressSubmit()` (Lines 732-771)
   - Handles form submission from modal
   - Validates address is not empty
   - Sends update to backend
3. `handleDeliveryAddressUpdate(orderId, address, orderStatus)` (Lines 773-808)
   - Updates address when user edits the field
   - Auto-saves on blur (when field loses focus)

**Modified UI (Line 938):**

```javascript
// BEFORE: {order.status === 'PENDING' && (
// AFTER:
{['PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED'].includes(order.status) && (
  // Show fulfillment buttons
)}
```

**Added Modal Component (Lines 1018-1057):**

```jsx
{
  deliveryModal.isOpen && (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50...">
      {/* Modal with address input and confirm/cancel buttons */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
