## ✨ Pro Tips

1. **Save your MongoDB connection string** - You'll need it for Vercel
2. **Generate new secrets for production** - Don't use dev secrets in production
3. **Test APIs locally first** - Verify everything works before deploying
4. **Monitor Vercel logs** - Check logs if something isn't working
5. **Use MongoDB Atlas free tier** - Completely free for development
