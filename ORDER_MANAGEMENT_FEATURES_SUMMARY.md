**A. Revert Progress**

- Only available for orders not in pending, cancelled, or delivered status
- Reverts order to previous status in progression sequence
- One-step revert only (cannot skip steps)
- Status Progression:
  - pending → confirmed → in_progress → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → delivered

**B. Delete Order**

- Available for all orders regardless of status
- Permanent deletion (with confirmation dialog)
- Staff require approval permission
- Admin can delete without approval

**Authorization:**

- Both require approval for status-related operations

**UI/UX:**

- Three-dot menu icon (⋮) on each order card
- Context-aware buttons that appear/disappear based on order status

### 3. Database Schema Updates

#### 3.1 Status History Tracking

**Field:** `statusHistory` (Array)

```javascript
statusHistory: [
  {
    status: String, // The status changed to
    changedAt: Date, // When the change occurred
    changedBy: ObjectId, // User who made the change
    notes: String, // Description of change
  },
];
```

**Purpose:**

- Audit trail of all status changes
- Enables undo/revert functionality
- Tracks who made changes and when

#### 3.2 Cancellation Metadata Fields

- `cancelledAt` (Date): When order was cancelled
- `cancelledBy` (ObjectId): Which user cancelled it
- `cancelReason` (String): Why it was cancelled

**Purpose:**

- Track cancellation details for accountability
- Enable order restoration with context

## UI Components

### Customer Portal (`app/customer/page.js`)

**New/Updated Components:**

1. `EditOrderModal` - Modal form for editing pending orders
2. Action buttons in order details:
   - "Edit Order Details" (for pending/confirmed)
   - "Restore Order" (for cancelled)
   - "Cancel Order" (for pending/confirmed)

**State Management:**

- `selectedOrderForEdit`: Tracks which order is being edited
- `editModalOpen`: Controls modal visibility
- `undoLoading`: Prevents duplicate restore requests

**Handlers:**

- `handleEditClick()`: Opens edit modal
- `handleEditSave()`: Processes completed edits
- `handleUndoCancel()`: Restores cancelled orders

### Staff Portal (`app/staff/page.js`)

**New/Updated Components:**

1. `OrderCardMenu` - Three-dot menu for order actions
2. `OrderCard` - Updated to include menu component
3. `OrderListView` - Passes handlers to order cards

**State Management:**

- Order state managed at page level
- Handlers update local state on success
- Orders refresh via polling mechanism

**Handlers:**

- `handleDeleteOrder()`: Removes deleted order from state
- `handleRevertStatus()`: Updates order with reverted status
- Existing handlers (`handleStatusUpdate`, `handleCancelOrder`)

---

## Security & Authorization

### Authentication

- All endpoints require JWT authentication via `authMiddleware`
- Session-based for UI components via next-auth

### Authorization

**Customers:**

- Can only edit their own orders
- Can only cancel pending/confirmed orders
- Can only restore their own cancelled orders

**Staff:**

- Can edit any order's status
- Can revert status on any order
- Can delete any order (with approval)
- Require approval from admin for sensitive operations

**Admin:**

- Can perform all operations
- No approval required
- Full override permissions

### Approval System

- `requireApproval()` middleware checks user approval status
- Staff members need explicit approval from admin
- Helps prevent unauthorized operations

---

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors

- Invalid dates rejected with clear messages
- Invalid fulfillment types prevented
- Required fields enforced (e.g., delivery address for delivery orders)

### Authorization Errors

- 403 Forbidden for unauthorized users
- Clear error messages in responses
- Appropriate HTTP status codes

### Operational Errors

- User-friendly error messages in UI
- Retry mechanisms for network failures
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- Error alerts don't dismiss automatically (users must acknowledge)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Status History Implementation

- Every status change pushed to array
- Non-destructive tracking (original data preserved)
- Enables audit trail and recovery

### Edit Operation Validation

- Fulfillment type changes clear conflicting address data
- Date parsing validates format
- Weight constraints enforced (minimum 0.5kg)

### Revert Logic

- Strict progression: only go back one step
- Prevents reverting pending, cancelled, or delivered orders
- Status progression hardcoded for consistency

### Deletion Safety

- Permanent deletion (no soft delete)
- Confirmation dialog required
- Staff need approval for execution
- Admin approval not required

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Soft Deletes**
   - Mark orders as deleted instead of permanent removal
   - Enables recovery and compliance

2. **Audit Reports**
   - Generate reports from statusHistory
   - Export change logs for compliance

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Revert multiple orders at once
   - Bulk status updates

4. **Change Notifications**
   - Notify customers of status reverts
   - Alert admin of unusual changes

5. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter by who made changes
   - Filter by change timestamp ranges

6. **Integration with Appointments**
   - Auto-update appointments when order reverts
   - Cascade status changes to related records

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Order is not cancelled" error when trying to undo

- **Solution:** Verify order status is actually "cancelled" in database

**Issue:** "Cannot revert further" when trying to revert pending order

- **Solution:** Only non-pending orders can be reverted (design by requirement)

**Issue:** Menu actions not appearing

- **Solution:** Check user role and approval status

**Issue:** Edit modal not opening

- **Solution:** Verify order is pending/confirmed (only editable statuses)

### Debugging

Enable debug logging in API routes:

```javascript
console.log('Edit details request:', { orderId, updates, user: auth.user });
console.log('Status history after update:', order.statusHistory);
```

Check MongoDB directly:

```javascript
db.orders.findById(orderId).pretty(); // View all fields including statusHistory
```
