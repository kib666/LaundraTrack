---

## Implementation Details

### 1. NEW COMPONENT: UserProfileDropdown (`components/common/UserProfileDropdown.js`)

**Features:**

- **Reusable Component**: Used across Admin, Staff, and Customer portals
- **Role-Aware Styling**:
  - Admin: Purple avatar (bg-purple-500)
  - Staff: Green avatar (bg-green-500)
  - Customer: Blue avatar (bg-blue-500)
- **User Information Display**:
  - User initials (e.g., "JD" for John Doe)
  - Full name and email
  - Role badge with color-coded background
  - Account status badge (if available)
- **Logout Functionality**:
  - Properly clears session via `signOut()`
  - Redirects to homepage (`/`) after logout
  - Closes dropdown automatically after logout
- **Auto-Close Behavior**: Dropdown closes when clicking outside the menu

**Usage Example:**

```jsx
import UserProfileDropdown from '@/components/common/UserProfileDropdown';

// In your header:
<UserProfileDropdown />;
```

### 2. SECURITY FIX: Role-Based Portal Validation (`lib/auth/authOptions.js`)

**Critical Security Implementation:**
The authentication provider now validates that a user's role matches the portal they're attempting to access.

**How It Works:**

```javascript
// Portal Type to Required Role Mapping
const portalRoleMap = {
  admin: 'admin', // Admin portal only accepts admin users
  staff: 'staff', // Staff portal only accepts staff users
  customer: 'customer', // Customer portal only accepts customer users
};

// Validation Logic:
// 1. Check email exists ✓
// 2. Check account is active ✓
// 3. Verify password ✓
// 4. VERIFY ROLE MATCHES PORTAL ← NEW
// 5. Check approval status (staff/admin) ✓
```

**Error Message Example:**
If an admin tries to log into the customer portal:

```
"Invalid credentials for customer portal. Your role is admin, but this portal is for customers only."
```

**Location:** `lib/auth/authOptions.js` (lines 40-55)

---

### 3. INTEGRATION: Portal Authentication (`components/common/PortalAuthModal.js`)

**Key Change:**
The login handler now passes `portalType` as a credential:

```javascript
const handleLogin = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  const result = await signIn('credentials', {
    redirect: false,
    email,
    password,
    portalType, // ← NOW PASSED TO AUTH PROVIDER
  });
  // ... rest of logic
};
```

**Location:** `components/common/PortalAuthModal.js` (line 92)

---

### 4. INTEGRATION: Admin Portal (`app/admin/layout.js`)

**Changes:**

- ✅ Imported `UserProfileDropdown` component
- ✅ Added dropdown in top-right corner of AdminTopBar
- ✅ Removed old logout button
- ✅ Removed unused `User` icon import

**Location:**

- Import: Line 8
- Usage: Line 24 (in AdminTopBar component)

---

### 5. INTEGRATION: Staff Portal (`app/staff/page.js`)

**Changes:**

- ✅ Imported `UserProfileDropdown` component
- ✅ Added dropdown in top-right corner of StaffTopBar
- ✅ Removed old logout button
- ✅ Removed unused `User` icon import

**Location:**

- Import: Line 10
- Usage: Line 26 (in StaffTopBar component)

---

### 6. INTEGRATION: Customer Portal (`app/customer/page.js`)

**Changes:**

- ✅ Imported `UserProfileDropdown` component
- ✅ Added dropdown in LoggedInDashboard header
- ✅ Removed old logout button with LogOut icon
- ✅ Removed unused `LogOut` icon import

**Location:**

- Import: Line 25
- Usage: Line 937 (in header section of LoggedInDashboard)

## Security Improvements

### ✅ Cross-Login Vulnerability Fixed

**BEFORE (Vulnerable):**

```
Admin credentials (email: admin@example.com, password: securePass123)
↓
Try to login on Customer portal
↓
❌ BREACH: Admin gains access to Customer portal
```

**AFTER (Secured):**

```
Admin credentials (email: admin@example.com, password: securePass123)
↓
Try to login on Customer portal
↓
Credentials provider checks:
  - Email exists? ✓
  - Password correct? ✓
  - Role is 'admin' but portal requires 'customer'? ✗
↓
❌ LOGIN DENIED: "Invalid credentials for customer portal..."
```

### ✅ Session Security

- Logout properly clears all session data via NextAuth's `signOut()`
- No stale sessions remain after logout
- User is redirected to public homepage

### ✅ Role Validation at Provider Level

- Validation happens BEFORE session creation
- Cannot bypass by manipulating cookies
- Prevents unauthorized access at the authentication layer

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow with Security Check

```
User submits login form
↓
PortalAuthModal passes: email, password, portalType
↓
NextAuth credentials provider receives credentials
↓
authOptions.js authorize() function:
  1. Validate email & password provided
  2. Connect to database
  3. Find user by email
  4. Check user is active
  5. Compare password hash
  6. ← NEW: Validate portalType matches user.role
  7. Check approval status for staff/admin
  8. Generate JWT token
  9. Return user object for session
↓
Session created with validated user data
↓
User redirected to appropriate dashboard
```

### Logout Flow

```
User clicks "Logout" in dropdown
↓
UserProfileDropdown calls signOut()
↓
NextAuth clears session & cookies
↓
Manual redirect to "/" (homepage)
↓
User logged out and on homepage
```
