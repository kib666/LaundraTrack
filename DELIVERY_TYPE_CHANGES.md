# Delivery Type Change Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Customers can now change their order from **Pickup to Delivery** (and vice versa) at any point during the order lifecycle - not just when pending. They can make changes until the order is **COMPLETED**. When switching to delivery, customers are prompted to enter a delivery address.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Update - `/app/api/orders/[id]/route.js`

**Modified:** PATCH endpoint for customer order updates

**Previous Logic:**

- Customers could only update orders when status was `'pending'`

**New Logic:**

- Customers can now update fulfillment type when order status is:
  - `'pending'` (PENDING)
  - `'in_progress'` (IN_PROGRESS / Washing)
  - `'ready_for_pickup'` (COMPLETED / Ready)
- Updates are blocked only when status is `'delivered'` or `'cancelled'`

**Error Message Updated:**

- Before: "Cannot update order after confirmation"
- After: "Cannot update order after it has been delivered or cancelled"

---

### 2. Frontend Updates - `/app/customer/page.js`

#### New State

```javascript
const [deliveryModal, setDeliveryModal] = useState({
  isOpen: false,
  orderId: null,
  address: '',
});
```

#### New Functions

**`handleToggleFulfillment(order, fulfillmentType)`**

- When switching to `'delivery'`: Opens a modal to collect delivery address
- When switching to `'pickup'`: Directly updates the order via API
- Handles authentication and error messages

**`handleDeliveryAddressSubmit()`**

- Submits the delivery address from the modal
- Validates that address is not empty
- Sends PATCH request with `fulfillmentType: 'delivery'` and the address

**`handleDeliveryAddressUpdate(orderId, address, orderStatus)`**

- Allows customers to update delivery address on existing delivery orders
- Called when address input field loses focus (onBlur)

#### UI Changes

**1. Expanded Status Support:**

```javascript
// Before:
{order.status === 'PENDING' && (
  // Show buttons...
)}

// After:
{['PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED'].includes(order.status) && (
  // Show buttons...
)}
```

**2. Dynamic Help Text:**

```javascript
<p className="text-xs text-gray-500 text-center">
  {order.status === 'PENDING'
    ? 'Updates are instant while the order remains pending.'
    : 'You can change delivery type until the order is completed.'}
</p>
```

**3. Conditional Cancel Button:**

- Cancel button only shows for `PENDING` orders
- Delivery/Pickup switching is available for all allowed statuses

**4. New Modal Component:**

- Modal appears when customer clicks "Switch to Delivery"
- Requests full delivery address
- Has Cancel and Confirm buttons
- Validates non-empty address before submission
- Shows loading state while updating

## User Flow

### Scenario 1: Switch from Pickup to Delivery while In Wash

1. Customer views "In Wash" order
2. Clicks "Switch to Delivery" button
3. Modal opens asking for delivery address
4. Customer enters address and clicks "Confirm"
5. Order is updated with delivery type and address
6. Customer can still update the address by editing the input field below the buttons

### Scenario 2: Switch from Delivery to Pickup while Ready

1. Customer views "Ready" order currently set to delivery
2. Clicks "Switch to Pickup" button
3. Order is immediately updated to pickup type
4. No additional inputs needed

### Scenario 3: Cannot Change Completed Order

1. Once order status is `'DELIVERED'` or `'CANCELLED'`
2. The fulfillment change UI is hidden
3. Cannot make any changes

## Technical Details

### Status Mapping

- `'pending'` → UI displays as `'PENDING'`
- `'in_progress'` → UI displays as `'IN_PROGRESS'` (In Wash)
- `'ready_for_pickup'` → UI displays as `'COMPLETED'` (Ready)
- `'delivered'` → UI displays as `'DELIVERED'` (Cannot change)
- `'cancelled'` → UI displays as `'CANCELLED'` (Cannot change)

### API Validation

The backend validates:

- User is authenticated
- User is the order owner (customer)
- Order status is in allowed list
- If switching to delivery: delivery address is provided and not empty
- fulfillmentType is valid ('pickup' or 'delivery')

### Real-time Updates

- Uses BroadcastChannel to sync across tabs
- Auto-refreshes orders every 5 seconds
- Immediate UI update on successful change
