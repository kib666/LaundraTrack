**Q: Can a customer change delivery type multiple times?**
A: Yes! They can switch back and forth as many times as needed until order is delivered or cancelled.

**Q: What if customer enters wrong address?**
A: They can edit it in the address field before the order is marked as delivered. Updates auto-save.

**Q: Can customers change the date?**
A: Not in this feature. Date changes require admin approval. This feature only handles delivery type.

**Q: Does changing type affect pricing?**
A: No, pricing remains the same. This feature only changes how the order is fulfilled.
