# Order and User Management Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Customer Orders Not Appearing in Admin Dashboard

**Problem:** When customers created orders, they didn't appear in the Admin's Orders section in real-time.

**Fixes Applied:**

- Updated `/app/api/orders/route.js` to properly format order responses with populated customer data
- Enhanced `/app/admin/orders/page.js` to use proper authentication headers
- Updated `/components/admin/OrdersTable.js` to correctly access order fields matching the database schema

**Changes:**

- Orders API now returns properly formatted data with all required fields
- Admin Orders page now includes Bearer token authentication
- OrdersTable component now correctly maps database fields (trackingNumber, customerId, deliveryDate, totalAmount)

---

### 2. ✅ Staff Registration Data Not Being Saved/Displayed

**Problem:** When staff created accounts, their data (name, phone, password) wasn't being saved or showing in User Management.

**Fixes Applied:**

- Created new `/app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.js` with PATCH and DELETE handlers
- Added POST handler to `/app/api/admin/users/route.js` for creating users
- Fixed `/components/admin/UserForm.js` to use correct field names (firstName, lastName, phone)

**Changes:**

- **POST `/api/admin/users`** - Creates new users with proper validation
- **PATCH `/api/admin/users/[id]`** - Updates user information
- **DELETE `/api/admin/users/[id]`** - Deletes users
- UserForm now separates firstName and lastName fields
- All data is now properly saved to MongoDB

---

### 3. ✅ Added "Approve" Button for Staff Accounts

**Problem:** Admin couldn't approve pending staff accounts directly from User Management.

**Fixes Applied:**

- Added `handleApprove()` function to `/app/admin/users/page.js`
- Added Status column to the users table
- Added conditional "Approve" button that appears only for pending staff members

**Implementation:**

- Green "Approve" button appears in the Actions column for pending staff
- Button calls `/api/admin/users/[id]/approve` endpoint
- Clicking Approve changes staff status from "pending" to "active"
- Staff can now log in after approval
