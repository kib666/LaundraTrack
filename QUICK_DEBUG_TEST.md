# Quick Debug Test Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser DevTools

```
Press F12 or Right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console tab
```

### 3. Test Token Issue (Staff Revert/Delete)

**Steps:**

1. Log in as Staff user
2. Keep Console visible
3. Try to Delete an order
4. **Copy all console logs** that start with:
   - `[STAFF DELETE]`
   - `[AUTH MIDDLEWARE]`
   - `[EXTRACT TOKEN]`
   - `[VERIFY TOKEN]`

**Expected logs if working:**

```
[STAFF DELETE] Token present: true
[STAFF DELETE] Token length: 200+
[STAFF DELETE] Token starts with: eyJ...
[STAFF DELETE] Response status: 200
[STAFF DELETE] Response data: { success: true, message: '...' }
```

**If error, you should see:**

```
[STAFF DELETE] Response status: 401
[STAFF DELETE] Response data: { message: 'No token provided' }
```

### 4. Test Weight Issue (Customer Order History)

**Steps:**

1. Log in as Customer
2. Keep Console visible
3. View order history (or navigate to the section showing orders)
4. **Copy all console logs** that start with:
   - `[CUSTOMER FETCH]`

**Look for this line:**

```
[CUSTOMER FETCH] Weight values in orders: [
  { id: '...', weight: 5 },
  { id: '...', weight: 10 },
  ...
]
```

**If issue, you'll see:**

```
[CUSTOMER FETCH] Weight values in orders: [
  { id: '...', weight: 0 },
  { id: '...', weight: null },
  ...
]
```

## üìã Server-Side Logs

### In Terminal (where `npm run dev` is running):

Look for these patterns in the terminal output:

**For Token Testing:**

```
[AUTH MIDDLEWARE] Received auth header: present
[AUTH MIDDLEWARE] Auth header format: Bearer eyJ...
[EXTRACT TOKEN] Input authHeader: present
[EXTRACT TOKEN] Checking startsWith("Bearer "): true
[EXTRACT TOKEN] Success - token length: 200
[VERIFY TOKEN] Attempting to verify token, length: 200
[VERIFY TOKEN] Token verified successfully, decoded userId: ...
```

**If failing:**

```
[AUTH MIDDLEWARE] Received auth header: missing
```

or

```
[EXTRACT TOKEN] Checking startsWith("Bearer "): false
```

or

```
[VERIFY TOKEN] Verification failed: Invalid or expired token
```

## ‚ùì Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Token present but response is 401

**Likely cause:** Token is invalid or expired
**Check:** `[VERIFY TOKEN] Verification failed` in terminal logs

### Issue: Token missing from session

**Likely cause:** User not properly logged in or session expired
**Check:** User is still logged in? Try logging in again

### Issue: Weight shows 0 in history but not null

**Likely cause:** Orders created before weight feature was added
**Check:** Try creating a new order and see if new orders show correct weight

### Issue: Weight shows null in logs

**Likely cause:** API endpoint not returning weight field
**Check:** Look at `/api/orders/route.js` line 83 - weight should be there
