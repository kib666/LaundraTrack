# 🎯 QUICK START - Flexible Delivery Type Feature

## ✅ What's Done

Your feature is **fully implemented and tested**. Customers can now change between pickup and delivery at ANY order stage (pending, washing, ready) - not just pending!

- Status check now allows: `pending`, `in_progress`, `ready_for_pickup`
- Was: only `pending` allowed
- Validation: delivery address required when switching to delivery

#### 2. **Frontend** → `/app/customer/page.js`

- Added delivery address modal
- Added 3 functions for handling fulfillment changes
- UI now shows buttons for PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED orders
- Address field auto-saves when user edits
